Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

The client wanted me to modernize their operations, using the most current and effective software tech. They deal with customers on a global scale including government agencies so abiding by safety and security standards and regulations was key.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

I feel that I did very well at understanding what was needed and adapting the software to the goal. I feel that software security is the number one priority for most software, and in the case of Artemis Financial, it could not be more true. A security breach when dealing with sensitive financial information is unacceptable and could lead to legal consequences that could devastate the company.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

The part that was helpful for me was understanding how dependencies can create false-positives, and how some vulnerabilities are just something you have to work around and apply patches to if available.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

Having a secure code base is the number one priority. In the future I would use OWASP to assess vulnerabilities and find potential mitigation techniques for.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

There is no way to ever be 100% certain that the code is secure, however, I followed industry standard best practices when coding and after refactoring the code I ran dependency checks to see if I created any new vulnerabilities.


What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

The maven dependency check and having a secure code base.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I would be proud to show my vulnerability assessment and how I was able to find solutions to various types of vulnerabilities with varying degrees of severity.
